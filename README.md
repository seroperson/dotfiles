maybe someday i will deal with that file. but for now i'm too lazy to do it.

# Installation

There are actually many ways of doing all the things, so you can not follow next
instructions if you know what are you doing.

So, first of all you have to clone everything to some location. Usually I am holding it
right at `$HOME` path.

```
git clone git@github.com:seroperson/dotfiles.git $HOME/dotfiles
```
